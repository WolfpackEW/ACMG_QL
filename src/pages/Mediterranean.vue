      Alameda County is fortunate to be situated in a Mediterranean climate zone similar to those countries bordering the Mediterranean Basin. A Mediterranean climate is typically cool and wet in the winter, with infrequent freezes, and warm or hot and dry in the summer, with very little summer rain. There is a large collection of plant species that are well suited to this climate, wherever it occurs. The Mediterranean Garden features many of these plants including Lionâ€™s Tail, Lavender, Jerusalem Sage, and Dwarf Olive Trees.
